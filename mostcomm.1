.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mostcomm
scans a directory of text files and reports consecutive lines that appear
in more than one file. It can help locate copy\-pasted sections, repeated
configuration and other duplicated content.
The command hashes each line and builds ranges shared between files.
Results may be filtered and sorted with the flags below.
Each result lists the file names and line ranges containing the
duplicated block along with the run length.
